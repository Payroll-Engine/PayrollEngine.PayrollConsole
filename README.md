# Payroll Engine Console Application
ðŸ‘‰ This application is part of the [Payroll Engine](https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine/wiki).

The Payroll Console application provides API-like commands. See the Payroll Engine samples and tests for examples of how to use this tool. For a better understanding of the working concepts, it is recommended to read the [Payroll Engine Whitepaper](https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine/blob/main/Documents/PayrolEnginelWhitepaper.pdf).

The application is controlled by two types of command line arguments:
- Command: a single command
- Command file: a file containing several commands.

## Commands
The Payroll Console provides the following commands:

| Command              | Group            | Description                                                  |

<sup>1)</sup> Tenant logs are generated by the regulations and should not be confused with the application log.<br/>
<sup>2)</sup> Based on [FastReports](https://github.com/FastReports).<br/>

The required command parameters and options/toggles are passed after the command name. An example of how to bulk import a payroll from a JSON file:
```cmd
PayrollConsole PayrollImport MyPayroll.json /bulk
```

The `Help` command describes the commands and their parameters:
```cmd
PayrollConsole Help PayrollImport
```

## Command Files
The command file is a file with the extension `.pecmd` that contains a series of instructions to the Payroll Engine Console. The lines of the file are executed sequentially and contain the following line types
- Comment starting with `#`
- Command instruction
- Start another command file

Example command file `Delete.pecmd` with a comment and a command statement:
```txt
# delete my tenant
TenantDelete MyTenant /trydelete
```

The following example uses the `Delete.pecmd` command file and then runs the command to test the payrun:
```txt
# clranup and execute test
Delete.pecmd
PayrunTest *.pt.json
```

### Command files access path
If the called command file is in a different folder, it will be activated before execution:
```txt
Test1/Test.pecmd
Test2/Test.pecmd
```

This is necessary if the called command file is to be defined with local references. The `keeppath` option prevents directories from being changed:
```txt
Tools/Import1.pecmd /keeppath
Tools/Import2.pecmd /keeppath
```

In the example above, both import command files are run in the startup folder.

### Command file parameters
Command files can also be controlled by parameters. Such parameters are used with the placeholder `$Name$` in the commands. In the following example, the command file `OwnerTest.pecmd` has the parameter `Owner`:
```txt
# payrun employee test
# argument owner: job owner
PayrunEmployeeTest fileMask:*.et.json owner:$owner$ /wait
```

Calling this command file with the `Owner` parameter looks like this:
```txt
OwnerTest.pecmd owner:Test01
```

## Application Extensions
The Payroll Console provides a plug-in mechanism for integrating custom commands:
- Command parameters with names and options
- Access to the Payroll REST API via the Payroll HTTP client
- Control output to console and logger
- Program exit code definition

To develop a Payroll Console extension, do the following
1. Develop the extension library in C# (example [PayrollEngine.Client.Tutorials](https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine.Client.Tutorials)).
2. Copy the output DLL of the library into the `extensions` subfolder of the application.
3. Display the command help `PayrollEngine Help MyCommandName`.
4. Run the command with `PayrollEngine MyCommandName`.

## Application Configuration
The Payroll Console configuration `appsetings.json` contains the following settings:

| Setting          | Description                          | Type                                       | Default        |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `StartupCulture` | The payroll console process culture  | string                                     | System culture |
| `ApiSettings`    | The backend api configuration        | [Backend API](#backend-api-configuration)  |                |
| `Serilog`        | Logger configuration                 | [Serilog](https://serilog.net/)            |                |

> It is recommended that you save the application settings within your local [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets).

### Backend API Configuration

| Setting   | Description                     | Type       | Default     |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `BaseUrl` | The backend base url            | string     |             |
| `Port`    | The backend url port            | string     |             |
| `Timeout` | The backend request timeout     | TimeSpan   | 100 seconds |
| `ApiKey`  | The backend [API key](#api-key) | string     |             |

The backend API configuration can be declared in the following locations.

| Priority | Source                                          | Content                                                        |
|--|--|--|
| 1.       | Environment variable `PayrollApiConnection`     | Backend API configuration [connection string](#api-configuration-from-connection-string).           |
| 2.       | Environment variable `PayrollApiConfiguration`  | Path to the backend API configuration [JSON file](#api-configuration-from-json).                    |
| 3.       | File `apisettings.json`                         | Backend API configuration [JSON file](#api-configuration-from-json) located in the program folder.  |
| 4.       | File `appsettings.json`                         | `ApiSettings` from the application configuration [JSON file](#api-configuration-from-json). |


#### API Configuration from connection string
The following is an example of a backend API configuration within a connection string:
```txt
BaseUrl=https://localhost; Port=44354; Timeout=02:46:40; ApiKey=MyApiKey; 
```

#### API Configuration from JSON
The following is an example of a JSON-based backend API configuration:
```json
{
    "BaseUrl": "https://localhost",
    "Port": 44354,
    "Timeout": "02:46:40",
    "ApiKey": "MyApiKey"
}
```

## Api Key
If a key is required to access the backend API, it must be obtained from one of the following sources (in order of priority):

1. Environment variable `PayrollApiKey`
2. Payroll HTTP configuration (see `PayrollEngine.Client.Core`)

## Application Logs
The payroll console stores its logs in the application folder `logs`.

## Solution projects
The.NET Core application consists of the following projects:

| Name                                     | Type     | Description         |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `PayrollEngine.PayrollConsole.Commands`  | Library  | Console commands    |
